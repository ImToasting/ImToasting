# Heya!

üëã My name is Justin Mcilravey  (he/him), and I'm a web developer from Seattle, Washington. I work at Discord on the Bots and API team, where I do front-end development using React. I've been doing web development for a long time now - I'm one of those ones that finds CSS fun, and tries to use it as much as possible.

## Recently...

I've been spending the past year in quarantine updating my personal blog and writing articles elsewhere, which has lead to a focus on blog software and discord utilities.

[Interaction Kit](https://github.com/ImToasting/interaction-kit) is a Discord HTTP bot framework I'm using to learn more about the Discord API and TypeScript.

[sentrydiscord.dev](https://github.com/ImToasting/sentrydiscord.dev) is a popular tool I developed for forwarding sentry alerts to a Discord server.

My [personal website](https://github.com/ImToasting/ImToasting.nl) is a little more developer-focused, relying on MDX and custom CSS to give me maximum flexibility with my content.

[Ramble](https://github.com/ImToasting/ramble) is an IndieWeb blogging platform I've been trying to invest more time into. It's not anything special right now, but I do have some fun plans for it. I hope to replace a few Ghost blogs I run with it.

[Aquarius](https://github.com/ImToasting/aquarius) is a Discord bot I've been maintaining for several years now that has found a niche use in some Discord communities.

I also wrote and maintain [Deschtimes](https://github.com/ImToasting/deschtimes), a project-management solution for foreign media translation groups.
